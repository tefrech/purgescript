<b>Problem:</b> The existing purge tool for an Access-based accounting system removed more records than it should have, affecting the accuracy of clients' financial reports.<br>
<b>Goal:</b> To build a new tool using SQL that accurately identifies customers, their contracts, and all related transactional records that qualify to be purged. For my own practice, I ported the tool to MySQL as well to utilize more modern functions.<br>
<b>Outcome:</b> We sped up reporting and processing times while keeping records accurate.
